#Regularization
#Welcome to the second assignment of this week. Deep Learning models have so much flexibility and capacity that overfitting can be a serious problem, if the training dataset is not big enough. Sure it does well on the training set, but the learned network doesn't generalize to new examples that it has never seen!
#You will learn to: Use regularization in your deep learning models.
#Let's first import the packages you are going to use.

#The non-regularized model is obviously overfitting the training set. It is fitting the noisy points! Lets now look at two techniques to reduce overfitting.
#2 - L2 Regularization
#The standard way to avoid overfitting is called L2 regularization. It consists of appropriately modifying your cost function, from:
J=−1m∑i=1m(y(i)log(a[L](i))+(1−y(i))log(1−a[L](i)))(1)(1)J=−1m∑i=1m(y(i)log⁡(a[L](i))+(1−y(i))log⁡(1−a[L](i)))

Of course, because you changed the cost, you have to change backward propagation as well! All the gradients have to be computed with respect to this new cost.
Exercise: Implement the changes needed in backward propagation to take into account regularization. The changes only concern dW1, dW2 and dW3. For each, you have to add the regularization term's gradient (ddW(12λmW2)=λmWddW(12λmW2)=λmW).

3.2 - Backward propagation with dropout
Exercise: Implement the backward propagation with dropout. As before, you are training a 3 layer network. Add dropout to the first and second hidden layers, using the masks D[1]D[1] and D[2]D[2] stored in the cache.
Instruction: Backpropagation with dropout is actually quite easy. You will have to carry out 2 Steps:
1.	You had previously shut down some neurons during forward propagation, by applying a mask D[1]D[1] to A1. In backpropagation, you will have to shut down the same neurons, by reapplying the same mask D[1]D[1] to dA1.
2.	During forward propagation, you had divided A1 by keep_prob. In backpropagation, you'll therefore have to divide dA1 by keep_prob again (the calculus interpretation is that if A[1]A[1] is scaled by keep_prob, then its derivative dA[1]dA[1] is also scaled by the same keep_prob).

Let's now run the model with dropout (keep_prob = 0.86). It means at every iteration you shut down each neurons of layer 1 and 2 with 24% probability. The function model() will now call:
•	forward_propagation_with_dropout instead of forward_propagation.
•	backward_propagation_with_dropout instead of backward_propagation.
In [16]:
 
parameters = model(train_X, train_Y, keep_prob = 0.86, learning_rate = 0.3)

print ("On the train set:")
predictions_train = predict(train_X, train_Y, parameters)
print ("On the test set:")
predictions_test = predict(test_X, test_Y, parameters)
Cost after iteration 0: 0.6543912405149825
Cost after iteration 10000: 0.06101698657490559
Cost after iteration 20000: 0.060582435798513114

On the train set:
Accuracy: 0.928909952607
On the test set:
Accuracy: 0.95
Dropout works great! The test accuracy has increased again (to 95%)! Your model is not overfitting the training set and does a great job on the test set. The French football team will be forever grateful to you!
Run the code below to plot the decision boundary.
